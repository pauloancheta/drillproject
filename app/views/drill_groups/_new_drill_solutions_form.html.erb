  ADMIN ONLY
  This form appears on the admin Drill Group show page to create new solutions for the newly created Question.
  Upon page load (prior to a new Drill being created), this form should either be hidden or not rendered.
  Upon successful submission, successful saves should save the Solution and automatically associate it with the displayed Drill. The form should be removed. A plaintext version (solution and type [exactmatch/regex]) should be prepended to the solutions container. Finally, a new form to create another solution should be prepended to the solutions container.
  Upon unsuccessful submission, the flash[:alert] should be rendered, and the page should remain as is.
