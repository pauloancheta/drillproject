  ADMIN ONLY
  This form appears on the show DrillGroup page. It allows the admin to create a Drill associated with the shown DrillGroup. It would be best for this page to rely on AJAX.
  Upon successful submission, this form should remove this form. In it's place, a plaintext representation of the newly created Drill (listing the title and description) should be rendered. Additionally, it should display the previously hidden form to add a new Solution to be associated with this Drill.
  Upon unsuccessful submission, the flash[:alert] should be displayed and the page should stay as is.
